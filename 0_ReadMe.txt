Welcome

Every macro should contain instructions in the few first lines in between ""/*... /* ""
If it's not the case, the readme is under process. 
In case, please contact benjamin.lacroix@crbm.cnrs.fr for further instructions. 

Macros can be installed in ImageJ going in the Plugitab:
Plugin > Macro > Instal... and will be operational after restarting ImageJ
